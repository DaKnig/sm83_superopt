* SM83 superoptimizer (name pending^TM)

this is gonna be a superoptimizer/synthesizer for sm83 asm.

input: C function for the host or asm code/machine code for the sm83.

params: 

1. grading function - or mode of operation; optimize for what?

2. code generator

output: superoptimized sm83 asm code that is equivalent to the input,
and is the best possible code to solve this. "best" is defined as "highest
score according to the grading function" so in the common cose this means the
smallest or fastest code to solve a problem.

** Goals

1. speed - speed is king; must be as fast and as efficient as possible at the
	cost of everything else; that's the most important thing.
2. portability - wanna run it on the most common hardware configs; currently
	the target is CPUs.
